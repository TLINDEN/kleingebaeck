=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool can be used to backup ads on the german ad page L<https://kleinanzeigen.de>.

It downloads all (or  only the specified ones) ads of  one user into a
directory, each ad into its own subdirectory. The backup will contain
a textfile B<Adlisting.txt> which contains the ad contents such as
title, body, price etc. All images will be downloaded as well.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You   can  create   a  config   file  to   save  typing.   By  default
C<~/.kleingebaeck> is being used but you can specify one with C<-c> as
well.   We    use   TOML   as   our    configuration   language.   See
L<https://toml.io/en/>.

Format is pretty simple:

    user = 1010101
    loglevel = verbose
    outdir = "test"
    useragent = "Mozilla/5.0"
    template = """
    Title: {{.Title}}
    Price: {{.Price}}
    Id: {{.Id}}
    Category: {{.Category}}
    Condition: {{.Condition}}
    Created: {{.Created}}

    {{.Text}}
    """

Be carefull  if you want  to change the  template.  The variable  is a
multiline string surrounded  by three double quotes. You  can left out
certain   fields  and   use  any   formatting  you   like.  Refer   to
L<https://pkg.go.dev/text/template>  for   details  how  to   write  a
template.

If you're on  windows and want to customize the  output directory, put
it into single  quotes to avoid the backslashes  interpreted as escape
chars like this:

    outdir = 'C:\Data\Ads'

=head1 SETUP

To setup the tool, you need to lookup your userid on
kleinanzeigen.de. Go to your ad overview page while NOT being logged
in:

    https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/s-bestandsliste.html?userId=XXXXXX

The B<XXXXX> part is your userid.

Put it into the configfile as outlined above. Also specify an output
directory. Then just execute C<kleingebaeck>.

You can use the B<-v> option to  get verbose output or B<-d> to enable
debugging.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables  are considered:

    KLEINGEBAECK_USER
    KLEINGEBAECK_DEBUG
    KLEINGEBAECK_VERBOSE
    KLEINGEBAECK_OUTDIR
    KLEINGEBAECK_LIMIT
    KLEINGEBAECK_CONFIG
    KLEINGEBAECK_IGNOREERRORS

Please  note,  that  they  take   precedence  over  config  file,  but
commandline flags take precedence over env!



=head1 BUGS

In order to report a bug, unexpected behavior, feature requests
or to submit a patch, please open an issue on github:
L<https://github.com/TLINDEN/kleingebaeck/issues>.

Please repeat the failing command with debugging enabled C<-d> and
include the output in the issue.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The C<kleingebaeck> doesn't currently check if it has downloaded a
file already, so it downloads everything again every time you execute
it. Be aware of it. This will change in the future.

Also there's currently no parallelization implemented. This will
change in the future.
