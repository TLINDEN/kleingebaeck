# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only  the latest  release  is supported.  If you  find  an issue  (any
issue!), please check with the latest release first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I don't agree with the "responsible disclosure" process most projects
(and companies) work these days.

So, if you find a vulnerability of any kind, please just open an
[issue](https://github.com/TLINDEN/kleingebaeck/issues). Please add
all details required to reproduce the vulnerability. You won't be chased.

That's just all about it.
